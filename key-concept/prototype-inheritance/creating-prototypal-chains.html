        this.color = color
      }

      //Now we need to assign Animal as the prototype for the Cat function 
      Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype)
      //but we want the assign the constructor at Cat and not Animal:
      Cat.prototype.constructor = Cat

      var chihaha = new Cat('Frida', 'beige');

      //let's make chihaha speak
      chihaha.speak();

      //the speak function is not a member of cat, so hasOwnProperty would return
      //false 
      console.log(Cat.hasOwnProperty('speak')); // false
      //But it is a member of prototype Animal. 
      //Now you wondering why we use 
      //Object.create here instead of just using New.
      //The big difference is that Object.create is not going to call the Animal
      //function, it's just going to set that function as the prototype and set up
      //the prototype chain.
      //if we call New. It would actually execute the Animal function
      //and we probably don't want to do that just while we're setting up our 
      //Cat function
      //We don't really want to call that until we're creating instances of cats
      //so that leads us to the thing we need to do. We do need to call our Animal
      //constructor from our Cat constructor. This way if anything needs to happen
      // to initialize an Animal upon construction, it will be taken care of.
      // We just do that like this. So that will call the Animal function passing
      // in : 
      //Animal.Call(this)
      
      console.log(chihaha ); // Cat {voice: "meow", name: "Frida", color: "beige"}
      console.log(chihaha instanceof Cat);     // true  
      console.log(chihaha instanceof Animal ); // true 
      console.log(chihaha.__proto__); // Object {}
      console.log(chihaha.__proto__.__proto__); // Animal{}

      //the three line important here are:
      //Animal.call(this, 'meow') 
      //Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype)
      //Cat.prototype.constructor = Cat
